# Personal MailMate Stylesheets

This repository holds all my personal MailMate stylesheets.

## Installation

Before you can select a style and install it you must make sure the proper
directory structure exists to hold it. This can be done using the following
command.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate/Resources/MmMessagesWebView
```

Once you have prepared the destination directy installation is simply a matter
of copying the selected stylesheet file into the proper location with the
proper name. For example if you wanted to install the `github_stylesheet.css`
as your chosen style then you would do the following.

```shell
cp ./styles/github/stylesheet.css ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate/Resources/MmMessagesWebView/
```
